Network Architecture of the proposed CU-Net. For MIR related tasks, the ﬁnal reconstruction (Point 4) is composed of the common reconstruction (Point 1) and the unique reconstruction (Point 2). For MIF related tasks, the ﬁnal reconstruction is composed of the common reconstruction (Point 1) and the two unique reconstructions (Point 2 and Point 3).
